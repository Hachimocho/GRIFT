Object Trainer {
    Uses everything else to \nactually run the project.
}
Object Nodes {
    Stores and loads \nspecific data types
}
Object Edges {
    Connects nodes and \nassigns traversal costs
}
Object HyperGraph {
    Stores all data in spatiotemporal \nrecursive format
}
Object GraphManager {
    Updates HyperGraph over time or\n in response to agents
}
Object Traversals {
    Moves pointers around a \nHyperGraph
}
Object Data {
    Defines and loads a specific data type
}
Object DataLoader {
    Loads a set of Dataset objects \ninto a single HyperGraph with \nmarked training/validation/testing nodes.
}
Object Model {
    Takes batched data from nodes\nand trains/validates/tests on it
}
Object Dataset {
    Loads a specific dataset into a graph format.
}
